# Smoke test configuration for fast validation
# This config enables minimal test runs that complete in < 2 minutes

# Data limits
max_samples: 200  # Use only first 200 rows for smoke tests

# Feature engineering (minimal)
lag_steps: [1]  # Single lag step
rolling_windows: [5]  # Single rolling window
rolling_stats: ["mean"]  # Only mean statistic
max_nan_ratio: 0.95  # Very permissive to keep more features

# Model training (minimal)
epochs: 1  # Single epoch for smoke tests
batch_size: 64  # Small batch size
val_fraction: 0.2  # Standard validation split

# GBM baseline specific
gbm_max_iter: 10  # Very few iterations for GBM
gbm_max_depth: 3  # Shallow trees
gbm_learning_rate: 0.1  # Standard learning rate

# Neural model specific
hidden_dims: [64]  # Single small hidden layer
